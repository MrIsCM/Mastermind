# Mastermind
Mastermind game:

Generates a random number of n different digits, that's the 'code'.
You have to 'crack' this 'code'. Each time you try to guess you receive some clues.
The clues:
    - Number of digits in your guess that are in the 'code' AND in the correct position.
    - Number of digits in your guess thar are in the 'code' BUT NOT in the correct position.
    
Once you correctly 'crack the code' it says how many tries you needed.
